# go-particle-system
Simple Go particle system.

This is a fun personal project I did as part of learning the Go programming language. It's similar to others I have done
in Processing and C++, but this if my favorite version. It's fairly basic, allowing users to place new particles into the
system with a left click, and to add some force with a right click. It also allows users to make "static" particles (ones
that absorb force) by holding the 'S' key while clicking. And there's a secret input that converts all the particles to
donuts. I'll let you figure out which key that is...

It uses SDL2 Go bindings by veandco for the graphics, windowing, and inputs.
